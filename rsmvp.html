								<h3>The Task</h3>
								<p>During Summer 2021, I was hired on at Ranchsense, an idea stage AgTech startup, as a software engineering intern tasked with creating the UI/UX and logical backend of what was to become the user platform.</p>

								<p>This was no ordinary UI/UX design task. I as in charge of creating the user website experience all the way from data transmission on the end devices to the quick access dahsbaords which were presented to the user on the front end.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>Tools Used</h4>
								<p> I utilized Losant's Enterprise Platform, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Postman, REST APIs, Webhooks, and Linux.</p>
								<p> I architected the data transmission from field device to front end via LoRaWAN protocol paired with cellular backhaul to route data to a cloud server to host encoded data packets for logging. 
									From here a series of Webhooks, API calls, JavaScript based decoding brought the data down to our front end dashboards and at-a-glance data aggregators so that our users could quickly read and digest the status of their devices. For this project, functionality was king. As a proof-of-concept to MVP solution, our experience had to offer everything we needed and nothing that we didn't at an accelerated pace so that our investors could grasp exactly what Ranchsene was planning to build and sell.</p>
								<h5>Takeaways</h5>
									<p> Through this process I learned valuable skills in time management, development costs, marketing, team development, and lots of programming as a result of my "trial-by-fire" introduction to the fast-paced and cutthroat nature of the early stages of technology startups. It was an unforgettable experience that I will remember for the rest of my life. I met many great people and mentors along the way, and the connections alone make up for all the late nights of Stack Overflow, head scratching, and caffeine  I endured that summer.</p>
