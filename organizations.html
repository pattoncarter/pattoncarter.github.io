								<h3>TAMU LEGION Men's Organization</h3>
								<p>Positions: Public Relations Executive, President</p>
								<p>After entering Texas A&M University during the hieght of COVID-19 in the Fall of 2020, I looked of on campus involvement when Sprong rolled around in order to expand my social circle, forge connections, and serve my community with my free time. I went to many recruitmnt events for various on campus social and service organizations on campus and found my people at LEGION. The diversity of the membership, the welcoming and non-judgemental culture, and the meaningful community impact I saw at LEGION met all of my criteria.</p>

								<p>After a semester with the organization, I decided to run for an officer position: Public Relations Executive. In April 2021, I became LEGION's youngest ever Executive. For the 2021-2022 academic year I ran the Instagram for the organization, created and sold merchandise, developed a recruitment plan involving informational & social events, on campus marketing, and facilitated social media efforts to bring in recruits. During my time, we had LEGION's most successful recruiting class of all time, bringing in nearly 80 applicants and 27 high quality new members. In addition to this I designed, sold, and distributed more merch than LEGION had ever before. I increased revenue by nearly 300% year over year and brought LEGION's brand to more people at Texas A&M than any other year.</p>

								<p>During the Spring of 2022 I decided I would run for the position of President for LEGION. After the success I had as the Public Relations officer, the members were confident enough in my dedication to the organization and ability to lead that they elected me the President of the organization for the 2022-2023 academic year. I'm excited to lead this organization to new heights and bring in even more talented, unique, and dedicated members throughout this year while expanding the role LEGION plays in affecting our community.  </p>

									<h3>TAMU FUSE</h3>
									<p>Finance Using Software and Engineering</p>
									<p>Positions: Co-Founder, Executive Vice President </p>
									<p>During the Spring of 2022 I was searching for a professional organization which combined software engineering and finance, two of my favorite topics. After much searching I came up empty handed. No organization really fit the bill, so I approached one of my friends who is studying finance to partner with me and create a club that combined these two interests. </p>

									<p>Together, my great friend Noah Collins and I created the idea of TAMU FUSE, an organization which combined software and finance and centered arounf the FinTech industry. We plan to launch the organization in Fall 2022 after countless hours of brainstorming, bureaucracy, talks with professors, officer recruiting, promotion, and everything else it takes to take an idea to a recognized organization at Texas A&M University. </p>

									<p>We're striving to establish the organization as a meeting place and incubator for talented, ambitious individuals who hope to incorporate software into the finance industry of tomorrow. With our team of officers, we plan to host social events, competitions, workshops, industry speakers, and much more for our members in an effort to equip them with a unique set of skills and connections that they can bring into their professional life far after their graduation date.</p>
