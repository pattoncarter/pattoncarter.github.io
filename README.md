This is a prepared template for your GitHub Pages deployment.

## Important: Additional Steps Required

After copying these files to your GitHub Pages repository:

1. Build your React application locally by running:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. Copy the build output files to this directory.
   - Usually these files are in a `dist`, `build`, or `out` folder
   - You'll need the JS and CSS files (typically in an `assets` folder)
   - Make sure to replace this index.html with the built one, but keep the routing script

3. Push the changes to GitHub

4. Your site should be available at your GitHub Pages URL shortly after pushing.
